YoutubeAdSkipper is Chrome extension to help skipping advertisements on Youtube player.

# Features
* Automatically skip ads.
* Add shortcut key to skip ads manually.

YoutubeAdSkipper is not yet packaged. Please install manually as below.
1. Extract zipped package at anywhere your local storage.
1. Open extension setting page (Type "chrome://extensions" at URL bar).

I would recommend to enable BrowserAction Icon.

# Usage
In auto skip mode, ad would be skipped after certain timeout value from a skipable ad appears on youtube player.
Also below short cut keys are enabled.
* 's' key :: Skip ad immediately in both auto and manual skip mode.
* 'Shift+s' key :: Toggle auto and manual skp mode. The mode can also be toggled at a context menu showed with mouse right click.
You can configure default mode and timeout values at option menu of this extension.
